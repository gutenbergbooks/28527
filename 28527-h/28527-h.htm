<h3><i>HOW TO BE A GOOD RADIO ACTOR</i></h3>


<p>The play in this book has actually been produced on the radio. Possibly
you have listened to this one when you tuned in at home. The
persons whose voices you heard as you listened, looked just as they did
when they left their homes to go to the studio, although they were
taking the parts of men and women who lived long ago and who wore
costumes very different from the ones we wear today.</p>

<p>The persons whose voices you heard stood close together around the
microphone, each one reading from a copy of the play in his hand.
Since they could not be seen, they did not act parts as in other plays,
but tried to make their voices show how they felt.</p>

<p>When you give these plays you will not need costumes and you will
not need scenery, although you can easily arrange a broadcasting studio
if you wish. You will not need to memorize your parts; in fact, it
will not be like a real radio broadcast if you do so, and, furthermore,
you will not want to, since you each have a copy of the book in
your hands. All you will need to do is to remember that you are taking
the part of a radio actor, that you are to read your speeches very distinctly,
and that by your voice you will make your audience understand
how you feel. In this way you will have the fun of living
through some of the great moments of history.</p>


<h3><i>HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS IN THE PLAY</i></h3>


<p>There are some directions in this play which may be new to you, but
these are necessary, for you are now in a radio broadcasting studio,
talking in front of a microphone. The word (<i>in</i>) means that the
character is standing close to the microphone, while (<i>off</i>) indicates that
he is farther away, so that his voice sounds faint. When the directions
(<i>off, coming in</i>) are given, the person speaking is away from the microphone
at first but gradually comes closer. The words (<i>mob</i>) or (<i>crowd
noise</i>) you will understand mean the sound of many people talking in
the distance.</p>

<p>Both the English and the dialect used help make the characters live,
so the speeches have been written in the way in which these men and
women would talk. This means that sometimes the character may use
what seems to you unusual English. The punctuation helps, too, to
make the speeches sound like real conversation; for example, you will
find that a dash is often used to show that a character is talking very
excitedly.</p>

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>We present here the story of the famous Revolutionary
hero and martyr, Nathan Hale. For the first scene of our
sketch, let us go to General Washington's headquarters in
New York City. It is early September of the year 1776.
In the Orderly room, outside of General Washington's
private office, sits Captain William Hull, a member of the
General's staff. Another officer comes through the door,
Captain Hull glances toward the newcomer, jumps up,
and exclaims&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Nathan Hale! As sure as I'm alive!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>William Hull! Well, well, this is a surprise!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>And you're a Captain! My congratulations, Nathan.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I might say the same to you, William!</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>What regiment are you in?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Knowlton's Rangers. And you?</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Well, as you see, I'm on the General's staff. I envy you!
Knowlton's Rangers, eh? Ah! There you have some
chance for adventure! Some chance to distinguish yourself,
while I&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Why, what's wrong with a staff appointment? I'd be honored
if it were offered to me.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Yes, so was I. That's why I'm here. I was a lieutenant of
artillery when General Washington asked me to join his
staff. I jumped at the chance&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Who wouldn't?</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>I wouldn't, again! Why, all I've done for two months is
write letters, sit at a desk, answer questions, and run errands!
It's no duty for a man who craves action!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, William, you have always been a fire eater.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Well, I eat no fire here, I can tell you. Now will you trade
jobs with me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>If General Washington asks me to&mdash;I'll do it&mdash;though
you haven't made it sound like a very attractive job, William.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Perhaps I've overdone it, Nathan&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HALE [<i>laughing</i>]</p>

<p>No use trying to crawl out of it now, William.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>But you&mdash;you're more used to this sort of thing than I
am. You're a schoolmaster&mdash;used to books and quills and
letter writing.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>That's true enough. You never had much love for books&mdash;as
I remember it you were rather a trial to the dominie
back home&mdash;by the way, what do you hear from South
Coventry?</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Not much&mdash;almost every man in the town enlisted.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, I keep running across South Coventry men everywhere
I go. It's a little town, but it has certainly done its duty
well in this war.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>If others had done as well, we wouldn't be in such dire
straits now!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Things do look pretty black for us.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Black! They couldn't be blacker!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Have you any idea what the General's next move will be?</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>No!&mdash;and what's more, I don't think he knows. It all
depends on General Howe's movements, and what those
will be nobody knows.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Is General Washington in his office now?</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Yes. Did you come to see him?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I was ordered to report to him.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>And here I've been keeping you out here&mdash;that shows
what a good staff officer I am! I'll announce you at once.
[<i>knock</i>]</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Yes, come in.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Sir, Captain Hale of Knowlton's Rangers awaits your
pleasure.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Ask him to come in at once, Captain.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Yes, sir. [<i>closer</i>] General Washington will see you now,
Captain Hale.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="center">HULL [<i>low</i>]</p>

<p>I'll wait out here for you. Come right in here! [<i>door
closes</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Captain Hale reports as ordered, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Come in, Captain&mdash;come in!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Thank you, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Will you sit here?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Thank you, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Colonel Knowlton informs me that you and your company
have been assigned to cover the North Shore line of
Long Island Sound.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Well, Captain Hale, I am seriously in need of exact information
which you may be able to secure.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>What is that, sir?</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Lord Howe's plans!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Can you get them?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I can try, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>You don't seem daunted by the magnitude of the undertaking.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>It is an order, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Well, my boy, no man knows better than I the impossibility
of some orders.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>But, sir&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>I hope, though, that this is not impossible. I have to have
the information. The safety of my whole army depends
upon it. I must know particularly where General Howe
intends to strike next.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>If he comes across the East River, we can protect ourselves
and keep out of his way. But if he comes across Long
Island Sound&mdash;do you realize what that may mean to us?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, sir. He can cut off our retreat.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Exactly! So that's what I must know.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I'll find out for you, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Good! Now, Captain, you may go about your task in any
way you see fit. I suggest two or three alternatives. First,
you may tempt one of the enemy or a Tory who has access<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
to the British lines, with a sum of money. You may
draw on me for whatever is necessary.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Or you might make a sally across the Sound, capture a
prisoner or two, and secure bits of information.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Or, though I hate to suggest it, you might go yourself in
disguise to the British lines, but that should be only in a
last desperate effort.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I understand, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Or if you could get in touch with certain persons on Long
Island who have been of service to us before&mdash;let's see&mdash;there
is a shoemaker in Jamaica&mdash;what is his name&mdash;oh,
here it is&mdash;Simon Carter.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Simon Carter. Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>If you can find any way to get in touch with him&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I'll find a way, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>The password is "Liberty" used twice in your first sentence
to him.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>I don't know what he can do for you, but he is trustworthy
and he may have some information.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I'll see him, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Now, Captain, I don't want you to go yourself unless it is
absolutely necessary. But I must have General Howe's
plans as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, sir. I understand. I'll see that you get them, sir.</p>

<p class="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Good! I believe you will, Captain. Good day.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Good day, sir. [<i>door closes</i>]</p>

<p class="center">HULL [<i>coming in</i>]</p>

<p>Well, Nathan, what news?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I've got a job.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>On the staff?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>No. I'm afraid it's more hazardous than that.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>You're lucky! A hazardous job! Say, what I wouldn't
give to be in your shoes! What is it? Are you at liberty
to tell?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Of course I'll tell you, William. I'm to discover General
Howe's plan of action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HULL [<i>whistles</i>]</p>

<p>I should say you had drawn a hazardous assignment! I'd
call it a labor of Hercules!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Perhaps.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>How are you going about it?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>There's only one sure way of doing it.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;and what's that?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I'll go myself into the enemy lines.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>In disguise?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>That may involve serious consequences, Nathan.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I know it, but I think it's my duty.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Listen, Nathan. Let me go instead. It's more in my line.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>No, William. The General has assigned me to the duty.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>But he didn't order you to act the spy, did he?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>No.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>And he doesn't expect you to.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>He expects me to get Howe's plans.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Look here&mdash;if I get permission to leave here, won't you
let me go in your place?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I'm afraid not, William.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Listen to reason! You have a father and mother; you're
engaged to be married. If by chance you were captured&mdash;well,
I hate to think of it. But I'm alone in the world,
it wouldn't make any difference what happened to me.
Let me go!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>It's no use, William. I appreciate your sentiment; but
General Washington has given me a duty to perform, and
I'd be a poor kind of soldier if I turned it over to anyone
else simply because it involved danger.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Let me go with you, at least!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Well, if you can get permission, I'd be glad to have you go
part of the way with me&mdash;though I must go into the
enemy lines alone!</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>But&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I insist on that! There is added risk in two of us trying to
work under disguise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Oh, very well. Have it your way. When do we start?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Early tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>I'll get permission to accompany you at once.</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So early the next morning Hull and Hale started out together.
They went into Connecticut and began looking
for some means of crossing the Sound to the North Shore
of Long Island. When they arrived near Norwalk they
heard that an American gunboat was lying offshore. They
determined to row out to it as soon as night came.</p>

<p>Our next scene is just after dark. Nathan Hale has put
on his disguise, while William Hull has found a rowboat,
and now draws up to the shore where Nathan is waiting
for him.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Hello, William, that you?</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>It's me, right enough. Come on, climb in.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>All right. Hold her there while I get aboard.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Easy, you'll have to jump for it! This is as close as I can
come with this old tub.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Steady now! Here I come&mdash;all right! I didn't even get
my feet wet!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Let me take a good look at your disguise. Hm&mdash;brown
homespun suit&mdash;yes&mdash;that's a poor enough fit even for
a penniless schoolmaster. And that hat! Yes, it'll disguise
you all right.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I hope so. Give me an oar, I'll help you pull to the gunboat.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Here you are. [<i>rattle of oar in oarlock</i>] All ready?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Pull away, [<i>noise of regular rattle of oars in the lock and
the swish of water continuing</i>]</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Where are you going first, Nathan?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I don't know. I'll have to let circumstances direct me.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Are you going directly to that shoemaker the General referred
you to?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>No, not directly. I'll see what I can do without any help
at first.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>You better change your mind and let me go with you.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>It's no use, William. I won't change my mind.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>You always were stubborn, Nathan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Perhaps. There's the gunboat, William!</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Sure that's it?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>No doubt of it.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Shall I hail them?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Let's pull in a little closer.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>All right, pull away. There's no light aboard.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>No&mdash;there wouldn't be. These waters are alive with
British boats.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>There! That's close enough! Give 'em a call now!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Ahoy, there!</p>

<p class="center">BOS'N [<i>distance</i>]</p>

<p>Ahoy! Look sharp there! Don't come any closer! Who
are you, and what do you want?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I want to speak to your Captain.</p>

<p class="center">BOS'N</p>

<p>Who are you?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>An officer of the Continental army!</p>

<p class="center">BOS'N</p>

<p>Stand by&mdash;I'll report you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HALE [<i>low</i>]</p>

<p>All right, William, as soon as I go aboard, row back to
shore, and wait ten days for me. If I've not returned by
then, go back and report me as lost.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Now, listen, Nathan! I've come this far with you, let me
go&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>We've settled all that, William, not once but several times.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Oh, all right.</p>

<p class="center">POND [<i>distance</i>]</p>

<p>Ahoy, there! What's wanted?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I wish to come aboard, sir, with your permission.</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Hello, there, your voice sounds familiar. You don't by
any chance happen to be Captain Hale?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, indeed. I'm Captain Hale. But you have the advantage
of me, sir&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Come aboard, come aboard, Captain. Don't you remember
Lieutenant Pond? I was in your regiment at the siege
of Boston.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Of course, I do, Pond. I'm glad to hear your voice.</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Come aboard, Captain, I'll lower a ladder for you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Bos'n!</p>

<p class="center">BOS'N</p>

<p>Aye, aye, sir!</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Lower the ladder for Captain Hale!</p>

<p class="center">BOS'N</p>

<p>Aye, aye, sir! [<i>gives orders for lowering ladder</i>]</p>

<p class="center">HALE [<i>during the confusion</i>]</p>

<p>Good-by, William. I'll try to be back in a week.</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Good luck to you, Nathan.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>If by any chance I fail to return, will you see that my uniform
and other effects are sent to my family?</p>

<p class="center">HULL</p>

<p>Of course I will, Nathan.</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Come aboard, Captain Hale!</p>

<p class="center">POND [<i>coming in</i>]</p>

<p>Here you are, careful now! Give me your hand and watch
yourself&mdash;there!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>What kind of an outfit do you call that you've got on!
I'd never have known you if I hadn't heard your voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>That's good, Pond!</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Good, why?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Because I'm bound for the enemy lines.</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>What? Not on spy duty, I hope?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Exactly. Will you give me passage to Long Island, and
land me in some secluded spot?</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Why&mdash;yes&mdash;if you wish it.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>You can do it without endangering yourself or your boat?</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>There'll be no difficulty about landing you. There is, however,
a British man-of-war, the <i>Halifax</i>, in these waters.
We have to watch out for her. But it's dark enough tonight
to be perfectly safe.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Good! Can we go at once?</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Yes, sir. [<i>calling</i>] Bos'n!</p>

<p class="center">BOS'N</p>

<p>Aye, aye, sir!</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Get the ship under way for Long Island! Bring her into
that secluded cove near Huntington! You know the place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">BOS'N</p>

<p>Aye, aye, sir! [<i>calling</i>] All hands on deck! Man the
windlass! Weigh anchor! [<i>etc.</i>] [<i>mob, setting sails, etc.</i>]</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Well, Captain Hale. This is new business for you, isn't it?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, I've been transferred to Knowlton's Rangers. Our
business is to get information. And I am under orders to
secure some information that I can get in no other way.</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Hm. It's not a sweet business.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>It's in my country's service! It seems that you, too, Lieutenant
Pond, are in a new business. How long have you
been in the navy?</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Two weeks.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I'm glad I found you here&mdash;I might have had some difficulty
in convincing a stranger that I was really an officer
in the Continental army.</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>That's true enough. You look&mdash;well&mdash;more like a
country schoolmaster than anything else.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>That's what I hope to pass for.</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>How long will you be on Long Island?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I shall try to be through my business in a week. I wonder
if you would meet me at the same place you are going to
leave me&mdash;say, a week from tonight?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>I'll send a small boat ashore for you, soon after dark a week
from tonight.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Good! I'll be there&mdash;unless&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Unless I am unexpectedly detained.</p>

<p class="center">POND</p>

<p>Oh, sir&mdash;we won't even think of that!</p>

<p>Our next scene is several days later, at the little shop of the

<p class="center">SIMON</p>

<p>Slickest thing ye ever see. And it's my own idea!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I wonder if you could hide some notes I've gathered in the
same way?</p>

<p class="center">SIMON</p>

<p>O' course I could. I'll resole both boots. Give me yer
notes.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Here they are. [<i>rattle of paper</i>]</p>

<p class="center">SIMON</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>It's Latin. I thought if they were discovered on me&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">SIMON</p>

<p>O' course&mdash;no soldier&mdash;that is, no redcoat could read
that furrin writin'. Well, I'll put it where they'll never

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>Our next scene is a few days later. It is evening. Darkness
is just falling. Mrs. Chichester, the keeper of the
Huntington Tavern, is bustling about her kitchen, when
Lieutenant Drew enters the back door.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Good evening, Mrs. Chichester.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>Good evenin' to ye, Lieutenant Drew. And what are ye
doin' comin' into my kitchen, I'd like to know?</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Your tavern room's crowded, and I thought perhaps you'd
serve me here.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>Indeed, I'll do nothing of the kind. There's room enough
in the tavern room.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>But I'll have no chance to talk to you out there. And I'd
as soon not eat as be deprived of your company.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>Go along with ye! Come on out here into the tavern room
or ye'll not git a bite to eat.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Your word is law&mdash;I can only obey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>Through this door&mdash;here.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Oh, very well&mdash;wait&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>Now what's the matter?</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Close the door, Mrs. Chichester! Did you take particular
notice of the man sitting alone in the corner?</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>The nice-lookin' young feller in the brown suit?</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>That's the one. Do you know him?</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>Never set eyes on him before.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Then he's not from Huntington.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>He is not! I know every young blood hereabouts. An'
he's not a native here, I kin warrant ye that.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>I have it!</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>What&mdash;don't scare a body to death! What have ye got?</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>I know where I've seen him! He's a rebel.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>A rebel! Indeed! In my tavern? I'll go throw him out!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>No! No! We must make certain first. But I think he's
an officer in the rebel army. Some months ago I was captured
near Boston. I escaped later. But while I was a
prisoner, I saw this fellow&mdash;unless I'm much mistaken.
I saw him again the other day in Jamaica, at the shoemaker's;
and now&mdash;look at him&mdash;here through the crack in
the door!</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>He's lookin' fer somethin'&mdash;out the winder.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>He's watching the shore of the cove!</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>Lookin' fer a boat to fetch him away, I'll warrant ye!</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Exactly! Now, Mrs. Chichester, let's set a trap for him.
Will you help me?</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>I will that! A rebel&mdash;and like as not a spy&mdash;in my
tavern!</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Go in to him, engage him in conversation, then look out
the window and remark that you see a small boat landing.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>Aye, I'll do it.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>If he starts up, I'll know he's my man.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>And then?</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Tell him you're mistaken. The darkness deluded you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>A small boat from my ship, the <i>Halifax</i>, is waiting for me
round the point. I'll bring it around with my crew and
we'll apprehend him.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>Good. Wait here&mdash;I'll go in now. [<i>door opens, laughter
and talk swell up</i>]</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>I hope, sir, ye found the roast beef to yer liking.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Yes, thank you, madam.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>Can I help ye to anything else, sir?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I think not, thank you.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>I'm sorry we have such poor fare, sir, but the times are
hard, what with the comin' and goin' of the troops; and
the rebels cleaned out the place when they were here.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I've fared very well, Madam.</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>Oh look&mdash;there in the cove! D'ye see a small boat comin'
into shore? I wonder what it can be doin' here?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Oh, indeed! I'm afraid I'll have to go, Madam! Let me
pay my reckoning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>There&mdash;I guess my eyes deceived me. It's not a boat at
all.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Ah!</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>What was that you said? Your reckoning? But sir, you've
had no sweetmeat. Come, sit down, I'll bring ye a bit o'
pastry.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>But&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">MRS. CHICHESTER</p>

<p>I'll take it much amiss if ye refuse me.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Thank you, Madam&mdash;I'll wait&mdash;bring your sweetmeat.</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>As soon as Hale finished his meal at the tavern, he went to
the shore of the cove to await the boat that he expected.
After some time he heard the splash of oars. So sure was
he that this was his boat that he stood up and called.</p>

<p>Rip his jacket to pieces, look in the lining and the seams!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Yes, sir. [<i>sound of tearing cloth</i>]</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Why am I suffering this indignity?</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Anything there?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Not a thing, sir.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Strip him&mdash;tear every piece of clothing to pieces!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Aye, aye, sir.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I trust this is giving you some pleasure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>We're enjoying ourselves, aren't we, boys?</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Aye, aye, sir.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Here, sir&mdash;a piece o' paper.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Let's see it&mdash;ha&mdash;receipt for lodgings. Is that the best
you can do?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>That's all there is, sir.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Perhaps, sir, now that you have ruined my clothes, you'll
let me go.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>I will not! I'll find where you've hidden your notes if I
have to rip your skin off!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I am helpless, sir. But you must be satisfied that I have
nothing on me. Can't you conclude your sport and let
me go?</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Look here, men&mdash;what about his boots?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Nothing in them, sir.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>He was having them resoled the other day! Ho, I'll wager
that's where they are! Give me your knife, Bos'n!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Here you are, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Hm! There&mdash;ah, ha! I thought so! Papers&mdash;papers&mdash;I
thought as much&mdash;bring the light nearer! Hm&mdash;what's
this? Some foreign tongue&mdash;Ah! Latin. Who
would have expected a rebel to know Latin?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I am a schoolmaster, sir.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>Aye, and a spy as well&mdash;as these notes prove.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Can you read them?</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>My Latin is a little rusty, but I can make out the tenor of
them. Hm&mdash;disposition of troops&mdash;probable movements
of army&mdash;yes, that will do! What have you to say
to that, my fine rebel?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p class="center">DREW</p>

<p>You don't need to. We've evidence enough to hang you
as it is. Bring him along, men! [<i>mob noise</i>]</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So Hale was taken aboard the <i>Halifax</i> and delivered late
the same night to General Howe, who, without the formality
of a trial, turned him over to the Provost Marshal, William
Cunningham, for execution the next day.</p>

<p>Our next scene is in the apple orchard of the Beekman
estate on Manhattan. Hale has been marched out for his
execution. He is standing under guard, near the tent of
Captain John Montressor, who, as our scene opens, comes
out of his tent, sees Hale, and speaks to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>Sir, I regret to see such a fine appearing young man in this
situation.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>You are kind to say so, sir.</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>May I ask your name and rank?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I am Captain Nathan Hale, of the Colonial army.</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>May I introduce myself? I am Captain John Montressor.
Can I be of any assistance to you?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I should be deeply grateful, sir, if I could write a few lines
to friends and relatives before I meet my fate.</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>Will you come into my tent?</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>If my guard&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>I'll tend to the guard.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>You'll find quills, ink, and paper on my field desk.</p>

<p class="center">HALE [<i>going</i>]</p>

<p>Thank you, sir.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>I say, halt there&mdash;where are you going?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>Never mind, Corporal! I'll be responsible for the prisoner.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Very good, Captain, but the Provost Marshal won't like
it! I can tell you that.</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>I'll take all the blame. The Provost Marshal never likes
anything, so that's no matter. Here, put this crown in
your pocket.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Right enough, sir. Thank you.</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>Do you know anything about the prisoner?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>No, sir. Ah, sir! Here comes the Provost Marshal!</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>Let me talk to him.</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM [<i>coming up</i>]</p>

<p>Where's the prisoner? Guard! Where's the prisoner?</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>Just at this moment, sir, he is writing a few notes in my
tent.</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>Bring him out here!</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>I'll get him, sir, if I may be allowed.</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>Go ahead, get him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>I'm sorry, Captain Hale, but the Marshal is waiting for
you&mdash;have you finished your letters?</p>

<p class="center">HALE [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Not quite, sir.</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR [<i>calling</i>]</p>

<p>He hasn't finished his letters, sir.</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>Fetch him along&mdash;he's written enough.</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>I'm sorry, Captain.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>Of course I'll come. May I ask you to deliver these letters
at your first opportunity?</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>Surely.</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>Guard, fall in around the prisoner.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Guard, fall in&mdash;'ten&mdash;<i>shun</i>! Quick step&mdash;march!
[<i>marching</i>]</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>Halt under the tree!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Guard, halt!</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>Put the prisoner on the ladder!</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>It isn't necessary, sir&mdash;I can climb the ladder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>All right then, get up there. Put the halter around his
neck, and blindfold him.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I can do that, too, sir.</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>All right, then, do it! And if you have any further statement
or confession to make, now is the time to do it.</p>

<p class="center">HALE</p>

<p>I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my
country.</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>Humph! Now, guard, when I give the word, kick the
ladder and let the rebel swing. Are you ready?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Ready.</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>Steady&mdash;now! [<i>noise of ladder, gasp, etc.</i>] [<i>pause</i>]
So let all spies, rebels, and traitors swing! March the guard
off!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Guard&mdash;fall in! Quick step&mdash;[<i>etc.</i>]</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR [<i>to himself</i>]</p>

<p>Poor fellow&mdash;and he's hardly more than a boy.</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>And now, Captain Montressor, I'll trouble you for those
letters.</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>Here they are, Marshal.</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>Ah&mdash;[<i>sound of tearing paper</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>What are you doing, sir? Stop it! Don't tear those letters
up!</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>I've already done it, Captain.</p>

<p class="center">MONTRESSOR</p>

<p>What did you do that for? They were intrusted to me for
delivery.</p>

<p class="center">CUNNINGHAM</p>

<p>Well&mdash;they won't be delivered! The rebels shall never
know they had a man who could die with such firmness!</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>The next day, however, Captain Montressor carried the
news to the American lines under a white flag and repeated
to Hale's companions those words&mdash;which have come
down to us: "I only regret that I have but one life to lose
for my country!"</p>
